"""
 The aim of the PSVPP
is to construct a feasible vessels schedule with minimized vessel charter and fuel costs, subject to constraints such as base capacity,
vessel capacity, spread of departures, voyage non-overlap, maximum voyage duration, and maximum number of visits on a voyage.
Each installation must receive the required number of visits within the planning period.
