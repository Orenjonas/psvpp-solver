# Periodic Supply Vessel Planning Problem solver

Implementing solvers for finding optimal planning schedules for periodic supply vessels based on research on the field.

Currently implementing a solution for finding the optimal amount of supply vessels and corresponding optimal sailing schedule for rigs based on supply demand.

Based on the paper by Borthen, Thomas, et al.[[1]](#1).
